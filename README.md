Understanding how opinions evolve is crucial for influencing public discourse and decision-making processes. We examine a bounded confidence model in opinion dynamics. 
The model simulates agents updating their opinions based on neighbors within a confidence range R, 
with advertisers introduced as fixed-opinion agents to influence the dynamics. 
We introduce two extensions for our model: sampling and rounding. 
In the sampling extension, agents interact with a random subset of neighbors to reduce computational complexity, 
while the rounding extension constrains opinions to discrete values to mimic real-world decisions. 
We analyzed optimization strategies by comparing linear and geometric placements of advertisers to maximize consensus while minimizing the number of advertisers required. 
Additionally, we developed dynamic models allowing advertisers to update their opinions based on evolving agent opinions to improve convergence and reduce polarization. 
The results indicate that smaller R values create polarized clusters while larger R values promote broader interactions and consensus. 
Also, geometric spacing of advertisers achieved higher consensus with fewer resources compared to linear spacing.
